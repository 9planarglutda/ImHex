Nitro PDF Pro is a legitimate software that offers a free 14-day trial with no credit card required[^3^]. You can download it from the official website of Nitro[^3^] [^4^]. Nitro PDF Pro is compatible with both Windows and Mac devices and has features such as PDF editing, creating, combining, converting (Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint), form creation and eSignature functionality[^3^] [^5^]. Nitro also offers Nitro Sign, an electronic signature solution, and Nitro Platform, a full suite of PDF and eSign tools for businesses[^4^].
 
Therefore, we do not recommend downloading or using Nitro PDF Professional 7.5.0.15 (x86) Keygen-BRD .rar as it is a pirated, unsupported and potentially dangerous file. Instead, we suggest you try the official Nitro PDF Pro for free or purchase a license from Nitro's website.

In this article, we will compare Nitro PDF Pro with some of its competitors and show you why Nitro is the best choice for your PDF needs.
 
## Nitro PDF Pro vs Adobe Acrobat DC
 
Adobe Acrobat DC is the most popular PDF software in the market, but it is also the most expensive one. A subscription to Adobe Acrobat DC costs $14.99 per month for the Standard plan and $24.99 per month for the Pro plan. Nitro PDF Pro, on the other hand, costs only $159 for a perpetual license. That means you can use Nitro PDF Pro for as long as you want without paying any monthly fees.
 
Nitro PDF Pro also offers more features and better performance than Adobe Acrobat DC. Nitro PDF Pro has a user-friendly interface that lets you access all the tools you need with ease. Nitro PDF Pro also supports batch processing, which allows you to perform multiple tasks on multiple files at once. Nitro PDF Pro can also convert PDFs to and from over 300 file formats, including Microsoft Office, image, HTML and more. Adobe Acrobat DC has limited conversion options and often produces errors or corrupted files.
 
Another advantage of Nitro PDF Pro is its integration with Nitro Sign and Nitro Platform. Nitro Sign is an eSignature solution that lets you send, request and track digital signatures with security and compliance. Nitro Sign also has features such as identity verification, templates, custom branding and workflow automation. Nitro Platform is a comprehensive suite of PDF and eSign tools that includes Nitro Analytics, a tool that captures ROI and usage metrics across all your Nitro products. Adobe Acrobat DC does not have such integrations or analytics capabilities.
 
## Nitro PDF Pro vs Foxit PhantomPDF
 
Foxit PhantomPDF is another popular PDF software that competes with Nitro PDF Pro. Foxit PhantomPDF has a similar pricing model to Nitro PDF Pro, with a perpetual license costing $139 for the Standard edition and $189 for the Business edition. However, Foxit PhantomPDF has fewer features and less customer support than Nitro PDF Pro.
 
Nitro PDF Pro has more editing tools than Foxit PhantomPDF, such as adding comments, annotations, stamps, watermarks, headers and footers, bookmarks and links. Nitro PDF Pro also has more advanced features such as OCR (optical character recognition), redaction, password protection, digital certificates and permissions. Foxit PhantomPDF lacks some of these features or requires an additional plugin to use them.
 
Nitro PDF Pro also has better customer support than Foxit PhantomPDF. Nitro offers 24/7 email support, phone support during business hours and online resources such as FAQs, tutorials and forums. Foxit only offers email support and online resources. Many customers have complained about Foxit's slow response time and poor quality of service.
 
## Conclusion
 
Nitro PDF Pro is the best PDF software for individuals, small businesses and large enterprises. It offers more features, better performance, lower cost and higher customer satisfaction than its competitors. It also integrates with Nitro Sign and Nitro Platform to provide a complete solution for your document productivity needs. You can download a free 14-day trial of Nitro PDF Pro from their official website or purchase a license from their online store.
