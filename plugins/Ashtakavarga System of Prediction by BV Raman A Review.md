One of the most authoritative and comprehensive books on this subject is Ashtakavarga System of Prediction by B.V. Raman, a renowned astrologer and scholar who was also the editor of The Astrological Magazine for over six decades. This book was first published in 1991 and has been reprinted several times since then.
 
The book covers the basic principles and concepts of ashtakavarga, such as the calculation of bindus (points), rekhas (lines), sarvashtakavarga (total ashtakavarga), bhinnashtakavarga (individual ashtakavarga), trikona shodhana (triangular reduction), ekadhipatya shodhana (lordship reduction), shodhya pinda (corrected points), and vimshottari dasha pinda (points for planetary periods).
 
The book also explains how to use ashtakavarga for various purposes, such as judging the strength and weakness of planets and houses, determining the auspicious and inauspicious times for different activities, evaluating the effects of transits and dashas, finding out the longevity and health prospects of a native, analyzing the marital compatibility and progeny prospects of a couple, predicting the rise and fall in profession and wealth, and assessing the spiritual potential and attainments of a person.
 
The book is enriched with numerous examples and illustrations from real horoscopes to demonstrate the practical application of ashtakavarga. The book also contains some rare and valuable information on topics such as ashtakavarga of divisional charts, ashtakavarga of lunar nodes, ashtakavarga of sub-planets, ashtakavarga of ascendant, ashtakavarga of special ascendants, ashtakavarga of vargas (divisions), and ashtakavarga of nakshatras (constellations).
 
The book is written in a clear and simple language that can be easily understood by beginners as well as advanced students of astrology. The book is also well-organized and systematically presented with appropriate headings, sub-headings, tables, charts, diagrams, and appendices. The book is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn and master the art and science of ashtakavarga.
 
If you are interested in reading this book, you can download it in PDF format from various online sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. However, we recommend that you buy a hard copy from a reputed publisher or bookstore to support the author's work and to get a better reading experience.
  
Ashtakavarga is based on the concept that each planet and sign has a certain amount of energy or influence that can be measured by points or bindus. The more bindus a planet or sign has, the more powerful and beneficial it is. The less bindus a planet or sign has, the more weak and malefic it is.
 
The points or bindus are derived from the positions of the planets in relation to each other and to the signs. For example, if a planet is in its own sign, exaltation sign, friendly sign, or in a trine or quadrant from another planet, it gets more bindus. If a planet is in its debilitation sign, enemy sign, or in a dusthana (6th, 8th, or 12th house) from another planet, it gets less bindus.
 
The total number of bindus for each planet and sign is calculated by adding up the bindus from all the other planets and signs. This is called the sarvashtakavarga or the total ashtakavarga. The sarvashtakavarga is divided into 12 parts corresponding to the 12 houses of the horoscope. Each part shows the number of bindus for each house. The more bindus a house has, the more auspicious and prosperous it is. The less bindus a house has, the more troublesome and unfortunate it is.
 
The sarvashtakavarga can be further refined by considering the individual ashtakavarga or bhinnashtakavarga of each planet. The bhinnashtakavarga shows the number of bindus for each planet in each house. The bhinnashtakavarga can be used to analyze the effects of transits and dashas of each planet on different aspects of life.
